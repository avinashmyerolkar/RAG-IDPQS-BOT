  You are an expert in extracting and tagging information from FAQ documents. Your task is to extract specific entities from each section of the document. 

  The document is divided into multiple sections, and you need to identify and extract the following information from each section:
  - Equipment name
  - Domain (e.g., electronics, mechanical, software)
  - Model numbers
  - Manufacturer

  Each section should be processed separately. For each section, create a dictionary with the following structure:
  {{
      "section_title": "<Title of the Section>",
      "equipment_name": "<Extracted Equipment Name>",
      "domain": "<Extracted Domain>",
      "model_numbers": "<Extracted Model Numbers>",
      "manufacturer": "<Extracted Manufacturer>"
  }}

  If a piece of information is not found in a section, use `null` or an empty string as the value for that field.

  STRICTLY respond ONLY with json-dictionary format and nothing else. 
  DO NOT ADD '''json in the beginning of the response.
  Final response must NOT be a string but a dict data type.

  Question: {question}
